Subject Area

As a home brewer, I need to keep up with the availability of barley. The datasets I have chosen should provide a good indication of weather patterns, the value of barley, and the status of exports.

Data Sources: 
•	Flat File: 
o	My flat file is a CSV format file that displays historical data on barley sales, exports, and the amount of stockpiled barley.
o	https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/feed-grains-database/resource/9f48d13c-765e-4c54-bc88-29b1542709e8
•	API: 
o	Current and historical climate data
o	https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted
•	Website: 
o	Barley consumption historical data
o	https://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=us&commodity=barley&graph=domestic-consumption

Relationships
•	Barley is the main ingredient in beer
•	Climate affects how barley grows 
•	Climate affects the quality of the grain
•	Availability is determined by climate and export vs stockpiled

My approach to this project will be concentrated mainly on US data, with some data from Europe, focusing on bushels harvested, bushels exported, and the price per bushel. I plan to compare this with rainfall, temperature, and snow totals.  I will use European data to investigate whether US barley is being used more in other countries than domestically. In previous studies, I have found that the US isn’t experiencing as many climate impacts as Europe, Asia, and specifically Egypt. I will use graphs to help me understand the relationships between barley harvest data and climate data, such as temperature and rainfall, during the growing season.

Data has been hard to come by that directly points out issues in the growing season for beer barley-producing regions. As a result, I may need to explore additional datasets and websites. This may cause a delay in the project's completion speed. The data that I have included here is a start, but it doesn’t have everything needed for this project. 

The ethical implications are small. This study focuses on beer-making grains, but barley is also used as a source of food for human consumption and as feed for animals. Egypt considers camels a sacred animal and feeds them only barley.
